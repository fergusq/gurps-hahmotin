# gurps-hahmotin

A library that can be used for creating and rendering GURPS character sheets.

## Usage

If you have Leiningen installed, you can generate a character sheet interactively by running:

	lein run sheet.html

This will ask you to choose several alternatives and then saves the resulting character sheet to `sheet.html` file.

It is also possible to generate a random character:

	lein run sheet.html --random
